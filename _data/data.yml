    title: ABOUT ME
    summary: |
      I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 
      advised by Prof. Tsung-Wei(TW) Huang.
      My research has focused on Task Graph Partition, Parallel Computing, and Design Automation. 
      With the amazing support from our research group and collaborators, I have published papers at three top-tier conferences: DAC, ICCAD, and ISPD.
      I love driving manuals during my free time. Yes, save the manual!

    info:
      - role: Research Assistant
        time: 2023.9 - Present
        company: University of Wisconsin-Madison
        details: |
          Designed PASTA, a task graph partitioning algorithm for static timing analysis, and implemented it in parallel CPU version (C-PASTA in ISPD'2024) and GPU version (G-PASTA in DAC'2024). 
          They both bring significant speedup to the update timing process in OpenTimer.
      - role: Research Assistant
        time: 2023.1 - 2023.8
        company: University of Utah
        details: |
          Worked on implementing various task graph partitioners (Repcut, Vivek's, GDCA) to speed up the update timing process in OpenTimer.
      - role: Teaching Assistant
        time: 2022.9 - 2022.12
        company: Rutgers University
        details: |
          Helped organize the course: ECE 14:332:231 Digital Logic Design. 
            - Designed the lab materials and policies.
            - Designed the final project (A simple RISC-V architecture written in SystemVerilog).
      - role: Master Student & Research Assistant
        time: 2021.6 - 2022.6
        company: Rutgers University
        details: |
            - Implemented R-tree motion planning algorithm for 2-D space searching in MATLAB.
            - Implemented a simple five-layer CNN inference phrase based on the systolic array architecture on a PYNQ-Z1 FPGA board. 
              Data is pre-trained in PC with PyTorch and loaded into DRAM through UART.
              The CNN computation part is implemented in Verilog on the FPGA part of the board. Data transfer is controlled by the SoC ZYNQ processor programmed in C. 
            - Implemented a parser in Java with RapidWright library to parse the placement information in Xilinx's Vivado Design Tools. The output of the parser, 
              which contains the placement information from Vivado, can be used as input to academic placers to improve the placement results from Vivado. The improved placement results from the academic placers can then be inputted back 
              to Vivado to finish the later routing process.
